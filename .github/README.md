<!-- Usually I header my projects with a link to the corresponding repo but this
is a special case; being the "Profile Repo" https://github.com/Skenvy/Skenvy, we
also don't need the typical "top header is repo name hyperlinked to itself"! -->

<!-- Host and src imgs without bloating this or using lfs, by committing images
to this's wiki. ```git clone git@github.com:Skenvy/Skenvy.wiki.git``` to get the

> [!CAUTION]
> Likey, nothing better symbolises the chaotic vibe of my approach to coding than this; the time when I was 15, stumbled upon a broken umbrella, and had no qualms asking, or answering: "Could you fit all the pieces of an umbrella in an apple?"

## Ethos üöé
Have you ever wanted to [start a cult](https://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Cult)? Thankfully in the software dev space, there's already a variety of cults to choose from!
### [Cult of Done](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13)
The "Cult of Done" is a nice set of quip-based motivationals, if those would help you. I first encountered it on [NoBoilerplate @ yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJQj1uKtnus).
<details>
<summary>The Cult of Done Manifesto</summary>

1. There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.
1. Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
1. There is no editing stage.
1. Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you're doing even if you don't and do it.
1. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.
1. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.
1. Once you're done you can throw it away.
1. Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being done.
1. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.
1. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.
1. Destruction is a variant of done.
1. If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.
1. Done is the engine of more.

The value of anything like this is in the self-determination of adopting it.
This doesn't need to be a serious thing, and it's best when it isn't!
These aren't hard and fast rules, anymore than you choose for them to be.

_My take?_

<img alt="Gif of Marge's iconic 'I just think they're neat' line." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Skenvy/Skenvy/assets/imgs/marge-i-just-think-theyre-neat.gif" width=480 height=360 style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/>

#### _Ghost of done_
My favourite quip from the manifesto is the "Ghost of done";
the value of an idea is not necessarily whether or not _you_ action it, or if you do, how you accomplish it.
Merely having the idea exist in whatever capacity out there in the void, is a facsimile of done.

Don't worry how it will turn out. [Just do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0).

## Projects üìÇ

> [!NOTE]
> I maintain several niche packages that besides their respective typical hosts, also live in [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/Skenvy?tab=packages).
>
> My open source contributions to other repositories can be seen [here](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Askenvy+-user%3Askenvy). You can similarly see yours [here](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+-user%3A%40me+).
>
> There's also my [gists](https://gist.github.com/Skenvy). One that I have favourited because I regularly access it is [SSH for multiple GH accounts](https://gist.github.com/Skenvy/8e16d4f044707e63c670f5b487da02c0).

1. [julia-release](https://github.com/Skenvy/julia-release): A github action to release a julia project in a way that feels more ideologically alligned with how I'm familiar with releasing, as opposed to julia's officially recommended release pattern.
1. [dependabot-linguist](https://github.com/Skenvy/dependabot-linguist) A ruby [package](https://rubygems.org/gems/dependabot-linguist) that can be used to have a guess as to what sort of dependabot configuration is appropriate for a given repository, with the primary use case of automating the configuration across multiple repositories without the need to manually investigate their contents.
1. [Collatz](https://github.com/Skenvy/Collatz): An attempt at a personal Rosetta Stone and collation of _language-fu-isms_, all attempting to achieve sort of the same thing, along with various general repository health examples, and learning github actions. There's probably more collatz repositories on GitHub than you could poke a stick at. This is just one of them. I picked the topic to match the goal of "personal Rosetta Stone" rather than the other way round. The choice of topic came from having a bunch of python scripts written years ago that went down a rabbit-hole, so I made this to make myself stick to KISS.
1. [Sudoku](https://github.com/Skenvy/Sudoku): A java JFrame implementation of a sudoku solver I wrote circa 2013 and have been sitting on with the desire to one day convert it into an android app. The distinction between this and other solvers is that this tries to catagorise the difficulty of the puzzle by which tactics it needed to solve it, that is to say, it tries to solve it using only specific techniques, in order, without resorting to heuristics / brute force that would be unobtainable for a person.

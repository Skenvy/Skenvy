# [Skenvy](https://github.com/Skenvy/Skenvy)
As GitHub tells us;
> Skenvy/Skenvy is a special repository.
>
> Its README.md will appear on your public profile.

> [!CAUTION]
> Usually, if a `.github/README.md` (_this file_) exists in a repo, it will be the first "`README.md`" selected to render when viewing the repo's default url.
>
> I assume that will remain true for this "special profile readme repo", but whether or not this will also be selected over the root `README.md` or not for what to render as the "profile README", is unclear / undocumented.
>
> If at some point in the future this does end up being what's displayed on the profile page instead of the root README and I don't notice, the actual profile README is [here](https://github.com/Skenvy/Skenvy/blob/main/README.md).

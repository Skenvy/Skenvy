## _GitHub Housekeeping_
The hosting site being GitHub means there are a few "special" repositories.
* `{username}/{username}`: [manage your GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile) with a [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme); See [Skenvy/Skenvy](https://github.com/Skenvy/Skenvy).
* `{username}/dotfiles`: ["GitHub does dotfiles"](https://dotfiles.github.io/) which can also be integrated with [codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles): See [Skenvy/dotfiles](https://github.com/Skenvy/dotfiles).

# [Skenvy](https://github.com/Skenvy/Skenvy)
As GitHub tells us;
> Skenvy/Skenvy is a special repository.
>
> Its README.md will appear on your public profile.

> [!CAUTION]
> Usually, if a `.github/README.md` exists in a repository, it will be the first "README" selected to render when viewing the repository at its `https://github.com/{user}/{repo}` url, rather than a root `README.md`.
>
> It appears that this repository's `.github/README.md` is also selected over the root `README.md` when deciding which one to render on the profile page. I would have preferred that to not be the case, so that I could have the root `README.md` render on my profile, and a separate `.github/README.md` render when viewing the repository directly, unfortunately that can't be done.
>
> I'm mainly leaving this here as a reminder to myself that I tried this already, incase I forget and try again. If at some point in the future this root `README.md` does end up being what's displayed on the profile page instead of the `.github/README.md` and I don't notice, the actual profile README is [here](https://github.com/Skenvy/Skenvy/blob/main/.github/README.md).
